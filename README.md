# UltimateFitness

**Ultimate Fitness** is a webapplication that helps users tracking their fitness progress and tries to keep them motivated. 
 


## Work distribution

The backend, frontend and layout tasks were not categorically divided so that all team members could gain practical experience in all three areas. Most of the work was done in teams of two, however every member implemented at least one part more or less alone.
